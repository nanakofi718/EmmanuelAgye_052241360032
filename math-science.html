        <p class="ovr_msg">
            The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of the four departments under the Faculty of
            Applied Sciences and Technology. The department has always maintained an old philosophy that
            “If you can’t count or measure it, you can’t manage it” therefore our activities affect all policies, 
            and touch all aspects of people’s lives. The Department of Mathematical Sciences came into existence after 
            a reorganization exercise in 2011. Currently plans are far advanced to split the Department into two namely;
            Department of Mathematical Sciences and Department of Statistical Sciences.
            The Department services all other Departments including parallel and evening programmes in the University.
            The department runs a three-year Higher National Diploma programme in Statistics which has been in Existence 
            since 1993 when the polytechnics were directed to fully implement the tertiary education reform programme.
            Subsequent to the endorsement by the National Accreditation Board (NAB), the Department inaugurated its flagship 
            top-up BTech Applied Statistics programmes with options in Health Statistics, Financial Statistics and Environmental 
            Statistics in 2016/2017 academic year. The Department also runs Diploma programmes in Health Statistics.
